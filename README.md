# cucumber-java-demo
This is a demo for cucumber java usage, contains:

1. pom file
2. write a feature file to communicate with customers
3. write steps to associate with technical world

In feature file, we will demonstrate the following keywords:
* feature
* scenario
* given/when/then/*

* Scenario Outline/Examples
* Background

A good bdd test should independent, we will also demostrate setup/tear down

i18n is another important topic in case of bdd. Although I do not like write code in Chinese,
but it is an exception in case of BDD, due to I do not want to force customer speak in code:)
